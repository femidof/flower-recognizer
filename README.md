# Flower Recognizer

A project that uses machine learning to detect if an image is a cat or a dog

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Processes used

I used a dataset from kaggle to train a model created from teachable machine.

And after the model has been trained, I exported it as tflite (tensorflow lite for mobile platform) model to be imported as an asset in flutter.
